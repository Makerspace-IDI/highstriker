# high Striker
Arduino project that uses a microphone and a ledstrip to simulate the "High Striker" also known as strength tester, or strongman game. 

##Highs Striker
In the orignal "High Striker" game it operates by utilizing the lever where one end holds a puck attached to the tower and the other end is struck by the person or contestant using a hammer or mallet. The aim of players is to ring the bell suspended on top of the tower. If the lever is struck with enough force, the puck will rise high enough to hit the bell, indicating a success.

This project will simulate this game, but instead of a lever, the player will have to scream into the microphone, and if the player screams high enough he will fill/ activate all the pixels in a LEDstrip.
